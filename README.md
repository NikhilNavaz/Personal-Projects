# Personal-Projects
Projects built with what i learned

Task Assistant:

A very primitive program that i wrote during early days of learning Python language. The program can speak verbally, recieve input, and execute other programs on command but it has to be hardcoded on doing so

Feature Engineering:

An project on using a dataset to find the factors that influence price negotiations while buying a house. There are 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

Image processing:
Detection, quantifiction and classification of parasitic infection from blood smear images using Matlab. This was done with the help of a workshop conducted in our institute by Matlab representatives. An automated function was developed to detect the presence of Babesia in bloor smears. The RBC count was also done using this technique. The method can be generalized to detect any entity in an image and do operations as needed.
